Old Herty Gurdy, here's the Nerdy Birdy!

So to refresh the brains, while there are a lot of updates that I need to make here in terms of content, the two things that I really could use your help with are:

1. You'd mentioned finding a way to make the site resizeable based on the browser/device, which sounds great!

2. I wanted to re-arrange the Works section, adding some kind of tag to each of the Works categories, such that when the page is opened,
   it shows all of the pieces at first, but when you click on a button saying, for example, Chamber Works, it would then only show works that had that particular tag. 
   Each piece could have multiple tags, so could show up, say, under Chamber Works AND Electronic works, etc.
   I'm not sure whether it's best to hide the other works or, say, kind of grey them out to leave only the currently selected pieces, but with no change of layout.
   So in this new setup, the layout would change slightly, with the categories throughout removed, replaced by buttons for each at the top.
   
   It would be good to do the same thing with the Scoring section, but once it's done in the Works section, I can implement the same deal there, so don't worry about that.
  
The html file to actually use is index163.html. It's just after the last live version, with just a tweak or two (an added work, I think).

Let me know about questions etc, and thanks for your help, Bobbo - I'll buy ya beers and foods!
